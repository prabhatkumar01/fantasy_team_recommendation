It's set to `null` if the player hasn't taken any wickets.\n    *   **batting\\_average:** The player's batting average against that team.\n    *   **teams\\_winning\\_batting\\_first**: Number of matches in which the player has played in the specified team and the team has won by batting first.\n    *   **teams\\_winning\\_batting\\_second**: Number of matches in which the player has played in the specified team and the team has won by batting second.\n    *   **batting\\_strike\\_rate:** The player's batting strike rate against that team.\n    *   **bowling\\_strike\\_rate:** The player's bowling strike rate against that team. It's set to `null` if the player hasn't bowled.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Data Source:**  This response assumes you are using a database or API to retrieve the actual player statistics. You'll need to replace the placeholder values (all currently set to 0 or `null`) with the real data from your source.\n*   **Null Values:**  I've used `null` to indicate that a player hasn't batted or bowled against a particular team (resulting in no runs, wickets, etc.).  This is a common practice for handling missing data in JSON.  You might need to adjust this depending on the specific requirements of your system.\n*   **Best Bowling Figure Format:** The `best_bowling_figure` is represented as a string (e.g., \"4/20\").  Ensure your data source provides the best bowling figure in this format, or adapt your code to convert it. If a player hasn't bowled against a team, it's set to `null`.\n*   **Error Handling:**  In a real-world application, you should add error handling to gracefully handle cases where the player ID is not found or data is unavailable.\n*   **Data Aggregation:** The code that *generates* this JSON response should be responsible for aggregating the data from your data source to calculate the total runs, highest score, best bowling figure, average, and strike rates.\n*   **Teams Winning batting first/second**: This assumes the number of winning matches by batting first or second out of the matches played by the player in the team.\n\nThis JSON structure provides a clear and organized representation of the requested player performance statistics, ready for use in applications or data analysis. Remember to replace the placeholder values with your actual data."
