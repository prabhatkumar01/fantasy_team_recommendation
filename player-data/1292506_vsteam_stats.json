You will need to retrieve the data from a cricket statistics website or database and then populate this JSON structure.\n*   **Data Source:**  To get the actual data, you would typically:\n    1.  Use a sports data API (if you have access to one).\n    2.  Scrape data from a cricket statistics website (like ESPNcricinfo or Cricbuzz - but be mindful of their terms of service).\n    3.  Query a cricket database.\n\n**Important:**\n\n*   **Replace the `null` values** with the real stats for the player against each team.\n*   **Error Handling:** When you fetch the data, be prepared to handle cases where a player hasn't played against a particular team or doesn't have any batting/bowling stats in certain matches. You might want to represent such cases with `null` or a special value like `-1`.\n*   **Data Accuracy:** Double-check the accuracy of the data you retrieve from any source."
