It contains the stats against each of the requested teams (GT, PBKS, LSG, DC, CSK, MI, RR, SRH, RCB).\n*   **Team-Specific Stats:** For each team, the following stats are included:\n    *   `matches_played`: Number of matches played against that team.\n    *   `runs_scored`: Total runs scored against that team.\n    *   `wickets_taken`: Total wickets taken against that team.\n    *   `highest_score`: Highest score in a single innings against that team.\n    *   `best_bowling_figure`: Best bowling performance (e.g., \"4/20\" meaning 4 wickets for 20 runs) against that team.\n    *   `batting_average`: Batting average against that team.\n    *   `teams_winning_batting_first`: Not a player stat, but a team stat that indicates the number of times the team batting first won the match.\n    *   `teams_winning_batting_second`: Not a player stat, but a team stat that indicates the number of times the team batting second won the match.\n    *   `batting_strike_rate`: Batting strike rate against that team.\n    *   `bowling_strike_rate`: Bowling strike rate against that team.\n\n*   **`null` Values:**  Currently, all the statistical values are set to `null` because the actual stats are not available.  You would need to populate this JSON object with real data from a cricket statistics database or API.\n*   **Data Population:**  To make this JSON useful, you would need to query a cricket stats resource (like ESPNcricinfo, Cricbuzz, or a dedicated cricket API) for Suyash Sharma's performance against each of these teams and fill in the `null` values with the corresponding numbers."
