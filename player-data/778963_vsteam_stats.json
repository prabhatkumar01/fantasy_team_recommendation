The value associated with each team is another dictionary.\n        *   **total\\_runs\\_scored:** The total number of runs scored by the player against that specific team.\n        *   **total\\_wickets\\_taken:** The total number of wickets taken by the player against that team (unlikely for a batter).\n        *   **highest\\_score:** The highest score the player has achieved against that team.\n        *   **best\\_bowling\\_figure:** The best bowling performance by the player against that team (runs conceded / wickets taken). If the player hasn't bowled, it's set to \"0/0\".\n        *   **batting\\_average:** The player's batting average against that team.\n        *   **teams\\_winning\\_batting\\_first:** Number of times the player's team won against the specified opposition when batting first.\n        *   **teams\\_winning\\_batting\\_second:** Number of times the player's team won against the specified opposition when batting second.\n        *   **batting\\_strike\\_rate:** The player's batting strike rate against that team.\n        *   **bowling\\_strike\\_rate:** The player's bowling strike rate against that team. `null` when the player hasn't bowled.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Data Source:**  This JSON structure *assumes* you have a reliable data source (e.g., a database or API) containing the player statistics.  I cannot provide the actual *data* because I don't have access to live cricket statistics databases.  You'll need to populate this structure with the correct information from your data source.\n*   **No Bowling Data:** If the player is primarily a batter and doesn't bowl against a particular team, the `total_wickets_taken` would be 0, `best_bowling_figure` would be \"0/0\", and the `bowling_strike_rate` would be set to `null`.\n*   **Error Handling:** In a real-world application, you'd want to include error handling to gracefully deal with cases where data is missing or unavailable for a particular player or team.\n*   **Data Accuracy:** The accuracy of this JSON structure relies entirely on the accuracy of the underlying data source. Double-check that the data you're using is correct."
