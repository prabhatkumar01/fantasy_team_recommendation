You would need to replace these `null` values with the actual performance data.\n\n**How to Populate the Data:**\n\nYou'll need to query a cricket statistics database or API to get the actual values for each of the `null` fields.  Here's a general outline of the steps:\n\n1.  **Access a Cricket Data Source:** Use a reliable cricket statistics website, API, or database (e.g., ESPNcricinfo, Cricbuzz APIs, or dedicated sports databases).\n2.  **Formulate Queries:** Construct queries to filter and extract the data for Abdul Samad (player ID 1175485) against each of the specified teams (GT, PBKS, LSG, DC, CSK, MI, RR, KKR, RCB). The specific query syntax will depend on the data source you are using.  You'll need to filter by:\n    *   Player ID\n    *   Opponent Team\n    *   Match Type (T20, IPL, etc. - clarify the scope if needed)\n3.  **Extract Relevant Data:** From the query results, extract the values for:\n    *   Total Runs Scored\n    *   Total Wickets Taken\n    *   Highest Score\n    *   Best Bowling Figure\n    *   Batting Average\n    *   Batting Strike Rate\n    *   Bowling Strike Rate\n    *   Teams winning batting first\n    *   Teams winning batting second\n4.  **Populate the JSON:** Replace the `null` values in the JSON structure with the extracted data.\n\n**Example (Illustrative - Replace with Real Data):**\n\nLet's say you found the following information for Abdul Samad against CSK:\n\n*   Total Runs: 50\n*   Highest Score: 25\n*   Batting Average: 16.67\n*   Batting Strike Rate: 142.86\n*   Wickets: 1\n*   Best bowling figures: 1/12\n*   Bowling strike rate: 12\n*   Teams winning batting first: 1\n*   Teams winning batting second: 2\n\nThen the \"CSK\" section of the JSON would be updated as follows:\n\n```json\n\"CSK\": {\n  \"total_runs\": 50,\n  \"total_wickets\": 1,\n  \"highest_score\": 25,\n  \"best_bowling_figure\": \"1/12\",\n  \"batting_average\": 16.67,\n  \"teams_winning_batting_first\": 1,\n  \"teams_winning_batting_second\": 2,\n  \"batting_strike_rate\": 142.86,\n  \"bowling_strike_rate\": 12\n}\n```\n\nRepeat this process for each team to complete the JSON with the actual performance stats. Remember to handle cases where the player might not have played against a particular team or hasn't batted/bowled. In such cases, you can keep the value as `null` or use appropriate placeholders like `0` or `\"N/A\"`."
