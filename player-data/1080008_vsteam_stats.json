For example, \"3-25\" means 3 wickets for 25 runs.\n    * **batting_average:** The player's batting average against that team (total runs / number of dismissals).  If the player has never been dismissed, it is null.\n    * **teams_winning_batting_first:** The number of times the player's team won against that team while batting first.\n    * **teams_winning_batting_second:** The number of times the player's team won against that team while batting second.\n    * **batting_strike_rate:** The player's batting strike rate against that team (runs scored / balls faced) * 100. If the player has not batted it is null.\n    * **bowling_strike_rate:** The player's bowling strike rate against that team (balls bowled / wickets taken). If the player has not bowled or not taken a wicket it is null.\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Data Availability:**  This JSON provides a template structure. To populate it with *actual* data, you would need to query a cricket statistics database or API. Without access to such data, I can only provide the structure with placeholder values (all currently set to 0 or null).\n* **\"0-0\" for best_bowling_figure:** If a player hasn't taken any wickets against a team, the best bowling figure is represented as \"0-0\".\n* **Null Values:**  `null` is used for batting average and strike rates when the player has not batted or bowled (depending on the metric).  This is a standard way to indicate that the value is not applicable or unknown.\n* **Fetching Data:** You'd typically use a programming language like Python with libraries like `requests` (to access APIs) and `json` (to parse the JSON data) to retrieve the data from a reliable source and then populate this JSON structure.\n\nTo make this response truly useful, you need to provide the data source (e.g., API endpoint, database connection details).  Then, I can help you write the code to fetch and format the data correctly."
