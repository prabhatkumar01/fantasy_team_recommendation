Set to `null` if no runs scored.\n    *   **`teams_winning_batting_first`**: Number of times the team won batting first.\n    *   **`teams_winning_batting_second`**: Number of times the team won batting second.\n    *   **`batting_strike_rate`**: Batting strike rate against that team. Set to `null` if no runs scored.\n    *   **`bowling_strike_rate`**: Bowling strike rate against that team. Set to `null` if no wickets taken.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Data Availability:**  This JSON structure is a template. To fill it with actual data, you need to query a cricket statistics database or API.  I don't have live access to such data sources.\n*   **`null` Values:** I've used `null` for batting/bowling averages and strike rates when no runs were scored or no wickets were taken.  This is a common practice to indicate the absence of a meaningful value.\n*   **\"Teams winning batting first/second\"**: It is difficult to determine which team (Zampa's team or the opposing team) won in those situations. I have defaulted these values to zero, but to provide accurate insight into these stats you need to consider which team Zampa was playing for to determine whether his presence was relevant to that win for his team.\n\nThis JSON format provides a structured way to represent the performance statistics as requested. To populate it with real numbers, you'll need to integrate it with a data source."
