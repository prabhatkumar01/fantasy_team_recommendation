(This may be null for primarily batsmen players)\n    *   `highest_score`: Highest individual score against that team.\n    *   `best_bowling_figure`: Best bowling performance (e.g., \"3/20\") against that team. (This may be null for primarily batsmen players)\n    *   `batting_average`: Batting average against that team.\n    *   `teams_winning_batting_first`: Number of times teams won batting first when this player was part of the match.\n    *   `teams_winning_batting_second`: Number of times teams won batting second when this player was part of the match.\n    *   `batting_strike_rate`: Batting strike rate against that team.\n    *   `bowling_strike_rate`: Bowling strike rate against that team. (This may be null for primarily batsmen players)\n*   **Null Values:**  I've used `null` as a placeholder for the data because the request was to provide a JSON structure, assuming the underlying data retrieval would happen separately. You would replace these `null` values with the actual statistics. If a player hasn't played against a specific team, or hasn't bowled against any team, `null` is an appropriate representation for the absence of data.\n\n**How to use this structure:**\n\n1.  **Data Retrieval:** You would write a script (e.g., in Python, Java, etc.) to query your database or data source that contains cricket statistics.\n2.  **Populate the JSON:**  Iterate through the teams (GT, PBKS, etc.) and, for each team:\n    *   Query the database to get the player's `total_runs`, `total_wickets`, `highest_score`, `best_bowling_figure`, `batting_average`, `teams_winning_batting_first`, `teams_winning_batting_second`, `batting_strike_rate`, and `bowling_strike_rate` against that specific team.\n    *   Assign the retrieved values to the corresponding fields in the JSON structure.\n3.  **Output the JSON:**  Finally, use a JSON library (e.g., `json` in Python) to serialize the Python dictionary into a JSON string and print or save it.\n\n**Important:**  This provides the *structure*. The actual data retrieval and population of the JSON requires you to have a data source (database, API, etc.) with the relevant cricket statistics and the ability to query it."
